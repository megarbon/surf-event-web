I remember buying my first pair of DKs. Danny Madison, Travis Pastrana. They started doing innovative, crazy stuff. 
Felt special to be on that team back then and even now, I'm stoked to be a part of this team again, and all these guys on the team are the next generation. 
They're ripping and it's just going to get bigger and better.
Passion after surfing. Feels like it did back when I started right for DC. 
You know, just pure stoked. Any is possible. No boundaries.
